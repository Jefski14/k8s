# After Travis CI adjusts their plan, we don't have enough free credit to run the build. So daily build has been adjusted to weekly. If you don't get latest version, please wait for one week.

# Why we need it

Mostly it is used during CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) or as part of an automated build/deployment

# kubectl versions

You should check in file [.travis.yml](.travis.yml), it lists the kubectl version and used as image tags.

# Involve with developing and testing

If you want to build these images by yourself, please follow below commands.

```
export tag=1.13.12

bash ./build.sh
```
Then you need adjust the tag to other kubernetes version and run the build script again.
